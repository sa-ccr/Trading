#' @description Calculates the number of repetitions needed for a specific number of consequtive failed trades/bet to appear. 
#' This can apply to roulette betting but also trading algorithms which use the same logic on doubling down after a failed trade.
#'  
#' @title Martingale Strategy Repetitions
#' @param length_of_targeted_sequence The number of consecutive failed trades/bets that we try to calculate the expected number of repetitions for 
#' @param prob_of_success The probability of a sucessful trade/bet
#' @param simulations_num The number of simulations to be run
#' @param trials_per_sim  The number of trials in each simulation
#' @param quantile_perc   (Optional) When set, the number of repetitions expected with such probability is returned.
#' @return A list containing the number of repetitions needed to reach the targeted sequence for the first time in each simulation 
#' (will be zero if the sequence is not found) and, when the quantile_perc is set, the above number of repetitions.
