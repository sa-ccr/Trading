Description: Contains trades from the five major assets classes and also
    functionality to use pricing curves, rating tables, CSAs and add-on tables. The
    implementation follows an object oriented logic whereby each trade inherits from
    more abstract classes while also the curves/tables are objects. There is a lot
    of functionality focusing on the counterparty credit risk calculations however
    the package can be used for trading applications in general.
