Trading R Package

Contains trades from the five major assets classes and also functionality to use pricing curves, rating tables, CSAs and add-on tables. The implementation follows an object oriented logic whereby each trade inherits from more abstract classes while also the curves/tables are objects. There is a lot of functionality focusing on the counterparty credit risk calculations however the package can be used for trading applications in general.
